### Description

CTRL+ALT+DE can be used in WinXP to invoke the task manager. But non bonafide software companies include a disable of this feature to prevent users from terminating their hidden adware/spyware. I know because they 'got' me!

It took me hours to discover he trick. An exclusive for the PSC community in return for all the goodies I received. A special thanks for Evan Toder who informed us of tools that helped me solve the riddle. UPDATED (tip of Roger Gilchrist)
